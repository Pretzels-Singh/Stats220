## *Memes!!!*
I Love browsing memes in my spare time therefore decided to make on of my very own.
Below is a meme I made using the R package [{magick}](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/magick/vignettes/intro.html).

My Inspiration/ Ideas for the Meme:

1. The Yamero Cat Meme was one of my Inpirations.
2. I also took Inspiration from a Gru meme and decided to combine the two.

I Have provided the `R` code below which I used to make the meme!
