## *Memes!!!*
I Love browsing memes in my spare time therefore decided to make on of my very own.
Below is a meme I made using the R package [{magick}](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/magick/vignettes/intro.html).

My Inspiration/ Ideas for the Meme:

1. The Yamero Cat Meme which happens to be one of my favourite memes
2. I took inspiration from this Meme and decide to make my very own.

I also probably should provide the `R` code I used to make the meme!
